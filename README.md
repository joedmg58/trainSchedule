# Train Schedule

This App show a basic train schedule.

The app calculate the next train arrival time and the time remaining for the train to arrive based on initial time entered by a user and the time frequency of the train. It ilustrate basic use of moment.js library and the use of Firebase as a database backend storage.

The app ilustrate basic creation, reading and deletion on a FireBase database.

We did this project as a group. The members are:

<ul>
  <li> Joseph Ragno </li>
  <li> Jose De las Salas </li>
  <li> Raul Tablada</li>
  <li> Joed Machado </li>
</ul> 

We used different techniques such as:

<ul>
  <li>Firebase</li>
  <li>Moment JS library</li>
  <li>JQuery</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

I made some late adjustment for using a modal dialog as a user input and added the deletion icons and its function.
